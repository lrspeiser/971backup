Jan. 4th 2:30-5 pm<br />Where: MVHS Room 112</div><h2>Notes from Evan Morrison's January 4, 2012 Awards Judging Seminar</h2><p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;

font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969);">Evan first gave an overview of his perception of the judging process and a rundown of the different awards.  He spent a lot of time discussing the technical/robot awards that he thinks play to our strengths and that we should actively pursue.  This was pretty interesting but I will leave that to the video.  We will not be posting this on the web but will keep it on a DVD.</span><br style="color: #222222;

font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969);">Evan then talked about how we should prepare for talking to judges at the competition.  He said to always be very polite to all judges in the blue shirts - even if the award they are judging is not one you think you'll get.  Apparently they talk among themselves and these impressions are critical.  They also watch how teams act even when they are not being judged - how they interact with each other and other teams.  This part of his talk would probably be good for everyone to watch before the competition.  Basically, everyone who is in the pit should be prepared to talk to judges.</p><p style="color: #222222;
