We do not ground it at the sensor end.  This helps a little bit more with signal integrity.</p><ul><li>For encoders without index pulses and potentiometers, we use a very high quality Belden 8723 cable that has two pairs of wires where each is individually shielded.  The conductors are 22 AWG made up of 7 strans of 30 AWG wires.  Here is the <a href="https://edesk.belden.com/products/index.cfm?event=printPrev&amp;pnum=8723&amp;ut=English">datasheet</a>.  It can be purchased in 100' long and more lenghts from <a href="http://www.mouser.com/Wire-Cable/Multi-Conductor-Paired-Cables/_/N-9lx96?Keyword=8723&amp;FS=True">Mouser</a> ($64/100ft on 2/25/17) and economically in 500' spools from <a href="http://www.markertek.com/product/bl-8723-500/belden-8723-2-pair-audio-and-control-cable-500-foot?utm_medium=shoppingengine&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=Product_Target&amp;utm_campaign=Shopping+-+Bulk+Cables&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=SIcnZTXy%7Cpcrid%7C74923778060%7Cpdv%7Cc%7C&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiA88TFBRDYrOPKuvfY2pIBEiQA97Z8MVD4EHd_Pw8WTrhZVQaQm6iDek0o646F4IedPQzCIEMaAkyS8P8HAQ">Markertek</a>. ($237/500ft on 2/25/17).</li><li>For encoders with an index pulse, we need a five conductor wire so we use Belden 5542FE three pair sheilded wire.  Here is the <a href="http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/46/5542FE-26646.pdf">datasheet</a>.  The shielding goes around all three pairs rather than around each individual pair like the Belden 8723 cable.  The conductors are 22 AWG made up of 7 strans of 30 AWG wire.  I have not found short lengths of it listed on vender websites.  I have been lucky and found a few odd lengths (100+ ft long) at Anxiter but they don't regularly sell it in shorter lengths than the 1000' spools.  Fortunately it is less expensive than the Belden 8723 cable.  The 5423FE costs $252.90/1000' on 2/25/17 from Anixter and $263.44/1000' on 2/25/17 from <a href="http://www.mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=5542FE">Mouser</a>.</li><li>The diagram in the image below shows how we wire an encoder and potentiometer using a single run of three pair Belden 5542FE cable.  The ground and power lines are shared by both sensors.  The encoder index pulse and the potentiometer signal line share the green and black pair. <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ddM7Pg8gRUMbhtukmZmRvP6syK5NZfOOQPSWL3SWyNU0L_x-j-yaWDRvVMuz-R9MnM7Ol7367xCrr57KUgdrClpyg_Q0A_4LP47kkyh9YhoAZv3ynjNO4mYbaZ9Lph3AV3TU2aEU86oXOR5GQVGUartiCn5Lu7LhRxkluRySBY5AovBW2dg0pjOdY2Ks9hWKADINChnIrUtoed7w4U-Zx0GZW5tgqsIi26ruRokGMx6DGoraHqtzUruo6b0j-g4cJvx90E1jh0dfUXVs4tLOXA-Tp0dWxsA2hfjofpWrKKtz3kiYe6eUA4ioavlUINgPt5EiDRwyusSHLbtZwFTc8MMxfCJhWAJ6A8HZcc-UgZhMbV3w1DSTDs06dCilvnHb3B8gUDaLsW0CpKE-DMwrFcDMTpQ5DTIzuzG_MlvXoM8JGNEkc359UHWuo2ntOLM5DBaigQIePJujJs8WZzU4BtUlAO8k2ygd1_9SiVACfCyfwbDjpK9ATvB1HW6LRt8gFd-C_TZwUk0gJopPJdpsx4aA4tLj7u9KXJa70c5wvagMTuqybWTP4lWGLfMihlos4OSWx2gM-NQ1tuFERdvD9pO6J05ceMb3CgINOD617XS76LqIIZft244lC9RWUvkiY3ZiDiqOK8geF9KctV3Oh3k4bRSS71C3Z9hHoKtwICo=w923-h615-no"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ddM7Pg8gRUMbhtukmZmRvP6syK5NZfOOQPSWL3SWyNU0L_x-j-yaWDRvVMuz-R9MnM7Ol7367xCrr57KUgdrClpyg_Q0A_4LP47kkyh9YhoAZv3ynjNO4mYbaZ9Lph3AV3TU2aEU86oXOR5GQVGUartiCn5Lu7LhRxkluRySBY5AovBW2dg0pjOdY2Ks9hWKADINChnIrUtoed7w4U-Zx0GZW5tgqsIi26ruRokGMx6DGoraHqtzUruo6b0j-g4cJvx90E1jh0dfUXVs4tLOXA-Tp0dWxsA2hfjofpWrKKtz3kiYe6eUA4ioavlUINgPt5EiDRwyusSHLbtZwFTc8MMxfCJhWAJ6A8HZcc-UgZhMbV3w1DSTDs06dCilvnHb3B8gUDaLsW0CpKE-DMwrFcDMTpQ5DTIzuzG_MlvXoM8JGNEkc359UHWuo2ntOLM5DBaigQIePJujJs8WZzU4BtUlAO8k2ygd1_9SiVACfCyfwbDjpK9ATvB1HW6LRt8gFd-C_TZwUk0gJopPJdpsx4aA4tLj7u9KXJa70c5wvagMTuqybWTP4lWGLfMihlos4OSWx2gM-NQ1tuFERdvD9pO6J05ceMb3CgINOD617XS76LqIIZft244lC9RWUvkiY3ZiDiqOK8geF9KctV3Oh3k4bRSS71C3Z9hHoKtwICo=w923-h615-no" alt="Encoder and Potentiometer Wiring Diagram from 2015" width="461" height="307" /></a> We used this in both the 2015 and 2016 robots.</li></ul></div></div></div>  </div>
