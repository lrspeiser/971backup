It's a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions. Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another with respect and kindness in the process. They avoid treating anyone like losers. No chest thumping tough talk, but no sticky-sweet platitudes either.  Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended. In the long run, Gracious Professionalism is part of pursuing a meaningful life. One can add to society and enjoy the satisfaction of knowing one has acted with integrity and sensitivity.</span><br /></strong></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7097876635380089" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;">Team 971</span></strong></h2><p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7097876635380089" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;">FIRST Team 971 is formed of a partnership between students and adult mentors. The team is structured so that students can learn real-life engineering, business, and life skills by working side-by-side with adult mentors. Students are encouraged and expected to take on responsible tasks. Our goal is to build a sustainable team that provides an enriching experience for students and mentors, grows to be a world class team, and has a lot of fun doing so!</span></strong></p><h3 style="line-height: 1.15;

margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;">The team does a lot of work and designing on the weekends when there is more time and there are more mentor resources available.  Because of the short design and build timeline, time critical projects will be worked on throughout the week and weekend.  A project started on a Wednesday evening during the competition season may have completely changed or be finished by the next Wednesday evening.  Members who want to see their projects through to completion need to show up to several meetings a week.  Some students and mentors work late into the evenings on weekends as we get closer to our deadlines, and the more students who are committed to help, when they can, on the weekends will allow us to get more done on the robot and increase our odds of performing well.  Students who spend a lot of time on robotics also find that their time spent is more fun and rewarding.</span></p><br /><p style="line-height: 1.15;

font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;"> Students who commit to being leaders on the team find it to be very rewarding.  Team leadership often spends time outside team meetings working on their leadership tasks, and this extra commitment should be understood and taken into account when stepping into leadership roles.  The leadership council works to make sure that students can be successful as leaders and still do well in school.</span></p><br /><p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;">Because a high level of commitment from team members is required to learn how to contribute and perform well as a team, students who do not make a minimum commitment (two meetings per week, including a weekend meeting during the competition season) will not be excused from school to attend competitions.  All students may attend competitions during the hours after school and are encouraged to do so.  All students are welcome to help during the competition.</span></p></span></h3><h1 style="text-align: center;

If you are interested in being on the drive team, first start by reading and understanding the <a href="#DriveTeam">Drive Team section of the team expectations web page</a>.</p><p>The competition drive team is selected at the end of the build season. Selection is based on more than just driving skill, and includes consideration of students’ involvement and interactions on the team throughout the year. Students need to demonstrate involvement on the team outside of drive practices if they would like to be considered seriously for drive team selection. The selected drive team is responsible for preparing for and competing in all in season and off season competitions for that season year. This selection is nominally re-done on an annual basis. </p><p>Our expectation is that the drive team is consistent throughout this duration, but there are exceptions where this may not be the case. The drive team is expected to operate according to the drive team expectations, and members will be removed if they are not following these expectations. Also, being on the drive team is not for everyone. Sometimes it becomes clear to the mentors that someone else will serve the team better, and in these cases drive team members will be replaced. </p><p>We do not hold tryouts during the build season. Instead, we base driving skill assessments off of off-season competition and practice performance. The team takes three robots to the Madtown Throwdown in November, which allows us to select two additional drive teams for this event. Also, the drive team for the competition robot sometimes has students graduate. When this happens, we hold an additional selection process to backfill those positions before our first off-season. We hold multiple open drive practices leading up to the selection of these drive teams in order to give everyone a chance to gain experience driving the robots. </p><p>Our general process for off season drive team member selection is as follows. We start with open drive practices to give everyone a chance to learn. We then have an open tryout where everyone trying out performs some task. We may or may not have multiple phases of narrowing, where extra consideration is given to a subset of candidates. The amount of time spent in each phase depends on how much time is available, and how much time is judged by the mentors to be appropriate. This selection process for the additional Madtown Throwdown drive teams usually starts with open practices in the summer and finishes in October.</p><p>For Madtown, members of the competition robot drive team may be interested in trying other roles within the drive team. They are welcomed to try out for these roles. If they are selected for a different role, their position with the competition robot will be backfilled through the same selection process.</p><p>Selection for the 3rd robot drive team is more heavily weighted towards involvement during the design, manufacturing, programming, and assembly of the 3rd robot, over involvement throughout the rest of the year. The 3rd robot drive team is not selected until after the 3rd robot is ready for drive practice, and the selection process may be compacted based on how much time is available.</p><p><strong style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;">Version 1.4 - Travis, Michael, and Kevin 8/13/18 - Added drive team selection process.</span></strong></p><p><strong style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;">Version 1.3 - Wyn and Finbarr 10/15/13 - Updated the text and removed Draft.</span></strong></p><p><strong style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; white-space: pre-wrap;">Version 1.2 - Draft by MJS 3/9/13 - Added Drive Team section.</span></strong></p></div></div></div>  </div>
