The fingerprint is "ec:18:1e:50:53:bf:97:cb:a4:88:b5:3e:ed:ae:26:7c".</p><h2 id=ssl>SSL Certificate</h2><p>This is the one that you will have to confirm accepting when accessing the SVN repository (either with a web browser or an SVN client) because it is self-signed by Michael Schuh. The fingerprint (SHA1) is "2C 13 56 EE BE 16 49 A6 CF CF 71 90 EA B9 C5 43
32 FB 7F 4D" (some tools may capitalize that differently or use other separators between the numbers). The current certificate is valid until 2015-05-15 12:18:56 PM.<br>
It was changed on 2014-04-10 because of the <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-098A">Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) vulnerability</a> which meant we couldn't trust that the old one wasn't compromised.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
