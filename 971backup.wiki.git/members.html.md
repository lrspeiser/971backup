This allows management to be in a constant state of evaluating how things are going to better meet the overall build schedule and manage tasks that are both non reliant and reliant on other aspects of build. <br /><br />One thing to make clear is that if a deadline has passed and someone else works on a project to make sure we meet a deadline or to finish something, it does not mean that the original person working on it failed.  The team understands that things happen, and something may not get done.  The best thing to do when you don't think you will be able to meet a deadline is the notify someone before the deadline so something can be done about it.  Regardless, just as a recommendation, do not get too attached to a project, since even if it is completed on time, it will most likely go through several iterations before going on the robot, or may not go on the robot at all depending on how the design evolves. <br /><br />As an end note, we discussed meeting times, and we decided that it would be advantageous to have one evening meeting in the middle of the week so mentors can help.  We tentatively decided on Tuesday evenings for these meetings, so Tuesdays we would meet after dinner instead of after school.</p><div><div><strong> </strong></div></div><hr /><h2>2011 Team Leaders</h2><h3>Team Captain: Scott</h3><p>The team captain is in charge of making sure that there is a robot built and that new members
