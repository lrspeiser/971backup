We used Acronis True Image 2017 to make a full backup and recovery disk (CD) from FRC 2016-4 and restore to a partitioned drive. The System partition must be first and have a size of 500MB. The rest of the drive is for the main C drive. When using Acronis to restore from a recovery disk, be sure to be patient when selecting target partitions for the clone, as at some points it may seem that the computer has hung. </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">The previous Windows 7 HDD failed in September and had to be replaced for the system to funtion properly.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Back in Prior to this failiure, the original HDD that came with machine failed back in June. <span style="font-size: 13.008px;">(original 250 GB died 6/26/16 due to SMART Error)</span></p></div></div></div>  </div>
