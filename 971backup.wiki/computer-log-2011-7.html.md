The update seemed to not be the issue, but after I opened chrome, the computer blue screened then restarted. I was not given any useful information from the computer. This all took place within a minute or two of starting the computer.  T<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">hanks, </span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Adrian Brandemuehl</span></p></div></div></div>  </div>
